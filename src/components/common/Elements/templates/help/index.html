				<button class="accordion">What is Selling on Lioneus?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>Selling on Lioneus is a platform that enables both individuals and businesses to sell their
						products to Lioneus customers. Signing up will enable you to sell on our Canadian, U.S., and
						Mexican marketplaces. </p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">Why should I sell on Lioneus?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>There are many reasons to sell on Lioneus—from the hundreds of Lioneus customers who can see your
						products to the ability to start selling fast without the need to create a new standalone
						website.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">What products can I sell on Lioneus?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						You can sell in a wide range of categories.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Are there products that I cannot sell on Lioneus?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p> Some products are prohibited or restricted based on a variety of reasons including, but not
						limited to, safety, health, and government restrictions. For more information about the kinds of
						products that cannot be sold on Lioneus.com, see <a
							href="https://www.lioneus.com/terms">Prohibited Content and Restricted Products.</a>. </p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">How can I sell on the Canadian, U.S., and Mexican marketplaces?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>When you sign up as a Business or Enterprise subscription you will have access to sell on our
						Canadian, U.S., and Mexican marketplaces through a North America Unified Account. This will
						enable you more easily to share product listing information and manage your inventory
						consistently across all three marketplaces. For all per-item transaction fees, sellers will pay
						the fees applicable to the marketplace in which the item was sold. If you're a Business or
						Enterprise seller, you will only be charged one monthly subscription fee for selling in North
						America. If you are a new seller registering to sell in Canada, the U.S., or Mexico, you can be
						paid directly in your local bank account in the local currency, provided you have a bank account
						in a country/region supported by Lioneus.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">When do I start getting charged the monthly subscription fee?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						The monthly subscription fee applies to Business or Enterprise selling accounts only, and your
						subscription begins as soon as you complete the registration process. Your first monthly
						subscription fee will be charged at that time unless otherwise stated in any promotional
						offers.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How do I get paid?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>Lioneus deposits payment into your bank account at regular intervals and notifies you that your
						payment has been sent. Disbursements can be made in Canadian dollars (CDN) to your Canadian bank
						account or in U.S. dollars (USD) to your U.S. bank account. For a settlement to take place, you
						must:
						<ul>
							<li>Have entered valid bank account information for your seller account.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">Can customers leave feedback and why is customer feedback important?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>Yes, customers can leave feedback about the products they purchase and their experience with
						sellers. As a seller, maintaining a high feedback rating is a critical factor for success on
						Lioneus. It's the best way for shoppers to identify you as a trustworthy seller. Your rating
						appears on the Offer Listing Page and is one of the first things that customers see. Customers
						are more likely to purchase products from sellers with higher ratings.</p>
				</div>

				<button class="accordion">Fees</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Lioneus fee is structured so that you can focus on what you do
						best. We only charge payment processing fees which are 2.9% + $0.30 per successful card charge.
