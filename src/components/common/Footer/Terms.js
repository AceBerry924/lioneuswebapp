              Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or
              product requirements (including age requirements) may apply.
              Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and
              those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if
              you use those Services.

            <p>
              This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what
              information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update,
              manage, export, and delete your information.

            <p>
              You can use our service in a variety of ways to manage your
              privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Lioneus Account if you
              want to create and manage content like photos, post, list or see
              more relevant search results. And you can use many Lioneus
              services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at
              all, like searching on the Site.
            </p>
            <p>

              (each, a "User") of the lioneus.com website ("Site"). This privacy
              policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered

            <h2>Personal identification information </h2>
            <p>
              We may collect personal identification information from Users in a
              variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit
              our site, register on the site, fill out a form, respond to a
              survey, and in connection with other activities, services,
              features or resources we make available on our Site. Users may be
              asked for, not limited to, as appropriate, name, business name,
              gender, email address, mailing address, phone number. Users may,
              however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal
              identification information from Users only if they voluntarily
              submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply
              personally identification information, except that it may prevent
              them from engaging in certain Site related activities.
            </p>
            <h2>Non-personal identification information</h2>
            <p>
              We may collect non-personal identification information about Users
              whenever they interact with our Site. We automatically collect log
              information when you use Lioneus, even if you have not created a
              Lioneus Account or logged in. That information includes, among
              other things: details about how you’ve used Lioneus (including
              links to third party applications), IP address, access times,
              hardware and software information, device information, device
              event information (e.g., crashes, browser type), and the page
              you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using Lioneus. We
              closely work with our users. In most cases, users may operate
              stores on Lioneus’s platform or sell or serve offerings to you
              through Lioneus. Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance User
              experience. We may use cookies and other similar technologies,
              such as web beacons, pixels, and mobile identifiers. We may also
              allow our business partners to use these tracking technologies on
              Lioneus, or engage others to track your behaviour on our behalf.
              While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser
              settings, we may not change our practices in response to a “Do Not
              Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile
              application. User’s web browser places cookies on their hard drive
              for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information
              about them. User may choose to set their web browser to refuse
              cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do
              so, note that some parts of the Site may not function properly.

            <h2>Compliance with Law </h2>
            <p>
              Lioneus may disclose your information to courts, law enforcement
              or governmental authorities, or authorized third parties, if and
              to the extent we are required to do so by law or if such
              disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with legal
              process and to respond to claims asserted against Lioneus, (ii) to
              respond to verified requests relating to a criminal investigation
              or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity
              that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal
              liability, (iii) to enforce and administer our Terms of Use or
              other agreements with Users, (iv) for fraud investigation and
              prevention, risk assessment, customer support, product development
              and debugging purposes, or (v) to protect the rights, property or
              personal safety of Lioneus, its employees, its Users, or members
              of the public. We will attempt to notify Users about these
              requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal
              process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law,
              or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile,
              ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an
              individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon
              Lioneus’s property, its Users and the Platform (collectively,
              “Risk Scenarios”). In instances where we comply with legal
              requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to
              notify that User about the request after the fact if we determine
              in good faith that we are no longer legally prohibited from doing
              so and that no Risk Scenarios apply.
